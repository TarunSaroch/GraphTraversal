## DFS (Depth First Search) ##

Graph traversal technique used to traverse a graph or tree data structure where the algorithm starts from the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to be visited.

DFS Algorithm:

- Start at the root node.
- Visit the first unvisited child node.
- If there are no more child nodes to visit, backtrack to the parent node.
- Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited.
- Use a stack data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
## BFS (Breadth First Search) ##

Also a graph  traversal technique used to traverse a graph or tree data structure where the algorithm visits all the nodes of a level before moving on to the next level. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited. Both DFS and BFS are important algorithms for graph theory and can be used to solve various problems.

BFS Algorithm:

- Start at the root node.
- Visit all the child nodes of the current node.
- Move on to the next level and visit all the child nodes of those nodes.
- Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited.
- Use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
